# Build Tracker

> **Single source of truth** for what is planned, in-progress, and done. Updated every time we cross a gate. If something isn't in this file, it isn't being built yet.

**Owner:** Aniket
**Started:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** Pre-build — Phase 0 gates not yet opened.

---

## 0. The build discipline (read once, follow always)

Every phase moves through **6 gates**. We do not skip gates. We do not write production logic before the gates ahead of it are green.

```

```

| Gate | What lands | Where it lives | "Green" means |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **G1 — Plan** | Architecture, scope, tech stack, data model for this phase | `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/gaps_design.md`, phase-specific section in this tracker | Reviewed + signed off in this tracker. No code yet. |
| **G1.5a — Visual prototype** | Static HTML + Tailwind clickable mock of every screen this phase touches | `prototype/*.html` | User opens it in a browser, clicks through, signs off. Locked design then back-ports into `ui_design.md`. |
| **G1.5b — Visual QA pass** | Playwright runs every prototype screen at desktop/tablet/mobile viewports, captures full-page screenshots, runs the §0.1 checklist section-by-section. Issues fixed before user reviews. | `prototype/qa/screens/<page>-<viewport>.png`, `prototype/qa/reports/<page>.md` | Every line of the checklist green for every page, every viewport. **Screen does not advance to user sign-off until QA is green.** |
| **G1.6 — Wiring inventory** | Every interactive element on every screen → mapped to its planned backend interaction (API endpoint, mutation, SSE stream) or marked client-only. Orphan UI is removed. | `prototype/wiring_inventory.md` | No interactive element exists without a documented purpose. The inventory becomes the input set for G2 — every "PLAN" row in the inventory must become an API contract in G2. |
| **G2 — API contracts** | Every endpoint's request/response, error shapes, status codes | `docs/api_contracts.md` | Reviewed, iterated, locked. Tests do not start until contracts are locked because mistakes here cascade. |
| **G3 — Test cases** | One test spec per endpoint + per service; happy path + edge + failure | `tests/specs/<phase>.md` + skeleton test files (red, not yet passing) | Every contract from G2 has a matching test. Tests fail (no logic yet) — expected. |
| **G4 — Build** | Service / handler logic | `src/kb/...` | Tests from G3 now pass. No new behavior beyond what G3 covers. |
| **G5 — Run** | End-to-end smoke against the live stack | `scripts/verify_<phase>.sh` | Service runs against docker-compose stack, smoke passes, no regressions in prior phases' tests. |

**Rules:**
1. **No backwards skips.** Don't add logic in G4 that wasn't covered by a G3 test. If we missed something, go back to G2, fix the contract, add the test, then continue.
2. **No phase advances** until G5 is green for the prior phase (with explicit exceptions noted below).
3. **Every G5 pass runs the full prior-phase test suite** — we don't let regressions hide.
4. **Tracker updates are non-optional.** When a gate turns green, this file gets a tick the same day.
5. **Plan changes update plans, not code.** If we change our minds mid-build, we go back to G1 of the affected phase, edit the plan, re-review, then re-enter G2.

### 0.1 Visual QA checklist (used at G1.5b for prototypes and G5 for production UI)

Applied **per page, per viewport** (desktop 1440×900, tablet 1024×768, mobile 390×844). The QA pass screenshots, runs through these checks, and reports findings before handing the page to user review. Source-of-truth template: [`prototype/qa_checklist.md`](../prototype/qa_checklist.md).

| Section | Checks |
|---|---|
| **Sidebar / left nav** | Collapsed-state icons all render · Hover-expand reveals labels cleanly · Active section visually distinct · Section dividers labelled · No overflow at any viewport · Keyboard focus visible |
| **Top bar / header** | Breadcrumb readable · Right-side actions don't overlap title at narrow widths · ⌘K hint present and aligned · Theme toggle present · No vertical misalignment |
| **Primary content area** | Max-width sane (text isn't a wide ribbon on big monitors) · Scroll behaves (sticky composer / header stays put) · Typography hierarchy clear (h1 → h2 → body) · Line-length 60–80ch for prose · Inline images/figures don't blow out the column |
| **Right panel (when present)** | Width fixed and reasonable (350–400px) · Header sticky · Inner scrolling independent of main column · Cards don't horizontal-scroll · Doesn't collapse content below readable threshold |
| **Interactive elements** | All buttons have visible hover state · All buttons have ≥36px touch target on mobile · Inputs show focus ring · Links underline on hover or have other affordance · Disabled states clearly muted |
| **Icons & imagery** | Every icon renders (no broken/missing) · Icon stroke widths consistent · Icons aligned with their labels (vertical baseline) · Logo / brand mark renders correctly |
| **Typography & color** | Body contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against background · No text below 12px except mono technical metadata · Mono font reserved for IDs/timings/snippets · Accent color used sparingly (≤ 3 instances per screen) |
| **Empty / loading / error states** | Each list/feed/table has an explicit empty state · Loading states are progressive (skeleton/stream, not centered spinner) · Errors are inline and recoverable |
| **Information density** | Whitespace appropriate for the surface (admin = denser, chat = airy) · No "wall of text" without visual breaks · Related elements grouped, unrelated separated |
| **Responsive** | At tablet: sidebar collapses by default · At mobile: right panel collapses to a tab or drawer · Tap targets respected · No horizontal page scroll |
| **Cross-page consistency** | Sidebar identical on every page · Top-bar height identical · Hover/focus patterns identical · Spacing scale identical |

**Each check has one of three states per page+viewport: ✓ pass · ⚠ minor (note, fix in production) · ✗ fail (block sign-off).**

### 0.15 Git workflow (every phase lives on its own branch)

Public repository · ongoing development. Branch model + commit conventions are non-optional.

```
            main  (protected · only fast-forward merges via PR)
              │
              ├─ phase-0/repo-skeleton ─────────────┐
              │     ├ commit per gate (G1, G1.5, G2, G3, G4, G5)
              │     └ PR opens at G5; review + merge
              │
              ├─ phase-1/schema-service ────────────┤
              ├─ phase-2/parse-layer ───────────────┤
              ├─ phase-N/<short-name> ──────────────┘
              │
              └─ feature/<descriptive-name>          (out-of-band fixes, docs)
```

**Branch naming:**
- `phase-N/<short-name>` — one branch per build-tracker phase (e.g., `phase-0/repo-skeleton`, `phase-10b/ui-chat`)
- `feature/<short-name>` — for cross-phase work (docs polish, dependency bump, tooling)
- `fix/<short-name>` — for bug fixes against `main`

**Commit conventions** (Conventional Commits, lowercase):
- `feat(phase-N): <gate> — <what>` for new functionality at a gate
- `test(phase-N): <gate> — <what>` for test work
- `chore(phase-N): <gate> — <what>` for non-functional changes
- `docs: <what>` for documentation-only changes
- `fix(phase-N): <what>` for bug fixes

Examples:
- `feat(phase-0): G4 build — docker-compose with postgres, pgvector, pg_search, minio`
- `test(phase-1): G3 specs — schema CRUD test scaffolds (red)`
- `feat(phase-1): G4 build — schema service CRUD endpoints; G3 tests now pass`
- `docs: back-port locked UI design into ui_design.md`

**Per-phase Git ritual** (interlocks with the 6 build gates):

| Gate | Git action |
|------|------------|
| **G1 Plan** | `git switch -c phase-N/<name>` from `main`. First commit on the branch: `docs(phase-N): G1 plan — <summary>`. |
| **G1.5 Visual prototype** (UI phases only) | Commits to the same branch as prototype HTML lands. Each screen sign-off: `feat(phase-N): G1.5 — <screen> prototype signed off`. |
| **G1.6 Wiring inventory** (UI phases only) | One commit per inventory pass. |
| **G2 API contracts** | One commit per contract or contract group: `docs(phase-N): G2 — API contracts for <endpoints>`. |
| **G3 Test cases** | One commit landing all G3 test skeletons (red): `test(phase-N): G3 specs — <what>`. |
| **G4 Build** | Many commits as logic lands; each makes some G3 test pass: `feat(phase-N): G4 — <what>`. |
| **G5 Run / verify** | `scripts/verify_phase_N.sh` lands + passes: `chore(phase-N): G5 — verify script + green run`. **Open PR**: title `Phase N: <name>` linking the relevant tracker rows. |
| **PR merge** | Squash-merge after review. Delete the phase branch. Tag if it's a phase boundary: `git tag phase-N-complete`. |

**Wave boundaries:** tag `wave-a-mvp` after Phase 12 ships green. Same for `wave-b-polish`, etc.

**Protected `main`:**
- No direct commits.
- Force-push disabled.
- PRs require: green CI, build-tracker gate row updated, no new failing tests.

**What never gets committed:**
- `prototype/qa/screens/` and `prototype/qa/reports/` — regenerable by running `node qa.mjs` (now in `.gitignore`)
- `prototype/node_modules/`, `prototype/package-lock.json` — regenerable
- `docs/Build a Knowledge Base Service.pdf` — the original problem brief, kept locally only; the public version is `docs/problem_statement.md`
- Anything in `.env*`, `.claude/`, `data/`, `pg-data/`, `minio-data/`

**Contributor entry point:** [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the short version; this section is the long version.

### 0.2 Cross-cutting design rules (applied on every page)

These are invariants — every screen must satisfy them. Violations block sign-off the same way QA fails do.

| Rule | What it means | Where it manifests |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema visible everywhere** | Wherever a field value is shown, its schema metadata (typed/inferred/collision · field name · type) is visible or one click away. The system must never display a value without letting the user see what schema produced it. | Doc Detail, Explore entity/doc/atomic-unit cards, Upload expanded rows, Chat citation cards, Extraction Studio. |
| **Schema editable everywhere** | Wherever a field value is shown, the user can edit it (with impact preview) or jump to Schema Studio to edit the definition. No "view-only" surfaces for schema. | Same as above. |
| **Doc Detail is universal** | Any doc / citation / entity / clause / atomic-unit → single click opens the same Doc Detail slide-in panel. No alternative drill-downs. | Every page. |
| **⌘K is global** | Global command palette reachable from every page. Jump to doc / entity / Studio tool / setting. | Every page. |
| **Streaming, not spinners** | Long-running things stream (ingest stages, chat responses, learning events). No centered spinners. | Upload, Chat, Dashboard. |
| **Trust signals on every answer/extraction** | Whenever the system shows a derived value (answer, extracted field, anomaly score, promoted field), it shows confidence + source. | Chat answers, Extraction Studio fields, Schema Studio promotions, Anomaly cards. |
| **Sidebar + top-bar identical** | Same components, same height, same hover/active behavior on every page. | Every page. |

These rules are checked at G1.5b QA in [`prototype/qa_checklist.md`](../prototype/qa_checklist.md) §12.

### 0.3 User-facing copy discipline

Engineering-roadmap and internal-design references **do not appear in user-facing UI**. They live in `docs/` and the tracker, not in the product.

**Forbidden in production UI copy:** Wave labels (A/B/C), phase numbers (Phase 0–23), internal design names (Design 1–9), library names (Hydra, OmegaConf, Procrastinate, RAPTOR, HippoRAG, ColPali), the corrections table by name, any `gaps_design.md §X` style citation.

**Allowed:** plain-English explanations of behavior. Example — instead of *"Logged to corrections (Design 4)"*, write *"Reason logged."* Instead of *"YAML rules resolved by Hydra/OmegaConf · DB overrides apply at runtime (Design 9)"*, write *"YAML rules per doc-type. Saving creates a new version."*

QA gates this at G1.5b — every prototype page is grep'd for the forbidden vocabulary before sign-off.

## 1. Now / Next / Blocked

**Now:** Phase 0 G3 — test specs + red skeletons for `/health`, `/ready`, migration runner, RLS isolation, middleware. Branch: `phase-0/repo-skeleton`.
**Next:** Phase 0 G4 — build (fill in the code that turns G3 skeletons green).
**Blocked on:** nothing. G1 ✅ signed off 2026-05-23 (corrected plan §5.1) · G2 ✅ signed off 2026-05-23 (contracts in `docs/api_contracts.md`).

---

## 2. Planning artifacts — completion checklist (pre-Phase-0)

These exist *before* any phase opens. They define the system as a whole. Each must be reviewed and confirmed before we open Phase 0 G1.

| Artifact | File | Status | Review needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mental model + locked decisions | [README.md](../README.md) | ✅ Done | Confirm scope + locked tech stack |
| Architecture spec (16 sections) | [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) | ✅ Done | Confirm: layers, storage, query pipeline, phasing |
| UI design (10 surfaces, locked) | [docs/ui_design.md](ui_design.md) + [`prototype/`](../prototype/) | ✅ Done | **Reviewed via clickable prototype (G1.5)** |
| 9 gap designs | [docs/gaps_design.md](gaps_design.md) | ✅ Done | Confirm each design is well-formed |
| Walkthrough (ingest + retrieval traces) | [docs/walkthrough.md](walkthrough.md) | ✅ Done | Reference doc, no review gate |
| Scenarios (8 enterprise stress-tests) | [docs/scenarios.md](scenarios.md) | ✅ Done | Reference doc |
| Red team | [docs/red_team.md](red_team.md) | ✅ Done | Open findings tracked in source doc |
| Citations audit | [docs/citations_audit.md](citations_audit.md) | ✅ Done | Reference doc |
| Competitive audit (2026 SOTA) | [docs/competitive_audit.md](competitive_audit.md) | ✅ Done | Wave B additions confirmed |
| Scale/perf audit | [docs/scale_perf_audit.md](scale_perf_audit.md) | ✅ Done | 18 weaknesses named — accepted |
| **Build Tracker (this file)** | docs/build_tracker.md | 🟡 In review | **You sign off** |
| API contracts | [docs/api_contracts.md](api_contracts.md) | ✅ Phase 0 contracts signed off 2026-05-23 | Phase 1 contracts land at Phase 1 G2 |
| Test specs (per-phase) | tests/specs/ | ⬜ Not started | Created per phase at G3 |

---

## 3. Tech stack — locked (no change without re-opening G1 globally)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Python 3.12, uv-managed | Modern toolchain, fast resolver, lockfile reproducible |
| **API framework** | FastAPI | Async, OpenAPI built-in, ecosystem maturity |
| **DB** | Postgres 17 + pgvector ≥ 0.8 + ParadeDB pg_search + ltree (built-in) | One transactional store; vector + BM25 + hierarchical labels in same place. Apache AGE deferred (MVP doesn't need Cypher; recursive CTEs cover lineage/chains). |
| **Test fixtures** | `testcontainers-python[postgres,minio]` ≥ 4.7 + `freezegun` (dev-only) | Hermetic per-session Postgres + MinIO; tests run without a pre-existing docker-compose stack. Freezegun for assertions on timestamps. |
| **Object store** | MinIO | S3-compatible; runs in docker-compose |
| **Queue** | Procrastinate | Postgres-backed; one fewer service |
| **LLM (extraction/plan/gen)** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Cost/latency target; adapter pattern so swappable |
| **Embeddings** | Gemini Embedding 001 | Same provider; high quality multilingual |
| **Reranker** | Cohere Rerank 3.5 | Best-in-class cross-encoder |
| **Parsers** | Docling (digital PDF), Mistral OCR 3 (scanned), openpyxl (xlsx), Gemini VLM (fallback) | Each is best-of-class for its modality |
| **UI** | Next.js 15 + Tailwind | SSR + streaming + ecosystem |
| **Streaming** | Server-Sent Events for ingest status, streaming responses for chat | Simpler than WebSockets, fits our flows |
| **Container** | docker-compose for local; container-per-service | Standard, portable |
| **Test runner** | pytest + pytest-asyncio + httpx | Standard FastAPI test stack |
| **Eval** | RAGAS + HHEM + custom 45-question stratified set | Multi-method confidence |

## 4. UI screen walkthrough — REVIEW REQUIRED before Phase 0 (via clickable prototype, G1.5)

**Information architecture — locked 2026-05-22, problem-driven:** chat is the front door (95% of users), Studio holds the power-user surfaces, Admin holds dashboards and logs. Universal **Doc Detail** slide-in opens from any citation/doc/entity anywhere. Global **Cmd-K** palette jumps anywhere.

**Process for each screen:**
(a) I build the static HTML+Tailwind page with realistic dummy data.
(b) I post the file path; you open in browser, click around.
(c) You push back: anything off, missing, unclear, or wrong from a KB-user perspective.
(d) I iterate.
(e) Row ticked when you sign off.
(f) Once all rows ticked, I back-port the locked design into `docs/ui_design.md` and Phase 0 G1 opens.

### 5.1 Phase 0 plan — Repo skeleton + docker-compose (G1 ✅ SIGNED OFF)

> **Status:** G1 ✅ signed off (corrected version) 2026-05-23 by Aniket. Plan locked. Branch: `phase-0/repo-skeleton`.
>
> **History:** initial sign-off 2026-05-22 (commit `d50c1c7`) → re-opened 2026-05-23 after gate-transition consistency review surfaced six drift findings against architecture §6/§7/§12 (commit `1ee9738`) → second sign-off this date. The corrections below are the canonical Phase 0 plan.
>
> **What changed in the re-open:** workspace-scoped tables now carry `workspace_id` + RLS policies day 1 per architecture §7; `audit_log` ships in its full partitioned shape per architecture §6 (hash trigger deferred to Phase 9); `processing_status` removed (lands at Phase 2 as `file_lifecycle`); column renames to match architecture's canonical names (`ts` → `created_at`); FastAPI middleware added for workspace context + request-id; Phase 0 ↔ Phase 9 split made explicit.

#### Scope

Phase 0 produces the runnable infrastructure that every later phase builds on.

**In scope:**
- Single-package Python repo layout under `src/kb/`.
- `docker-compose.yml` bringing up Postgres (pgvector + pg_search), MinIO, a Procrastinate worker container, and the FastAPI app — in one command.
- Cross-cutting tables that phases 1–8 will write to: `audit_log` (full partitioned shape, hash trigger deferred to Phase 9), `idempotency_keys` (workspace-scoped), `schema_migrations` (infrastructure).
- RLS policies on every workspace-scoped table from day 1, plus the FastAPI middleware that sets `app.workspace_id` per request.
- Migration runner — raw SQL files + a thin Python applier.
- Python project tooling (`uv`, `ruff`, `pyright`, `pytest`).
- FastAPI app skeleton with middleware mounted (no routes yet — `/health` + `/ready` open at Phase 0 G2).

**Out of scope (deferred):**
- Any application logic (schema service, parsers, chunkers, indexers, retrieval, extraction, identity, query, UI). Each owns its phase.
- Phase-specific DDL (schemas, raw_pages, chunks, embeddings, mentions, entities, queries, raptor_nodes). Each phase ships its own `migrations/sql/NNNN_*.sql` at its own G4.
- Next.js `web/` project — Phase 10a.
- CI workflows beyond a single smoke check.

#### Decisions (locked at G1; changes require re-opening G1)

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Repo layout | **Single Python package** at `src/kb/` with internal modules (`kb.api`, `kb.workers`, `kb.db`, `kb.storage`). API and worker share one image; differ only by entrypoint. | All later phases share schema/retrieval/eval primitives. Splitting now invents internal API surface that isn't needed. Process separation already happens via different entrypoints + Procrastinate queue, not packages. |
| 2 | Postgres image | **`paradedb/paradedb:latest-pg17`** | `pg_search` is a ParadeDB extension; the image bundles it with `pgvector`. Stock `postgres:17` + manual install is fragile. |
| 3 | Migration tool | **Raw SQL files + thin Python runner** (`migrations/runner.py`) tracking applied files in `schema_migrations`. | Architecture is DDL-heavy (extensions, partitions, HNSW, BM25, materialized views). Alembic autogenerate doesn't help with any of that; every migration would be hand-written. Avoids ORM coupling — multiple services use raw SQL. |
| 4 | Python tooling | **`uv`** (deps + lockfile), **`ruff`** (lint + format), **`pyright`** basic mode (types), **`pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` + `httpx`** (tests). | Modern, fast, no exotic choices. |
| 5 | Lifecycle DDL scope | **Narrow** — extensions + cross-cutting tables only. Each phase ships its own DDL at its own G4. | Lets table shapes evolve as the code using them gets written. Phase tables aren't pre-locked. |
| 6 | Row-Level Security (RLS) | **Enabled day 1** on every table that carries `workspace_id`. Policy: `workspace_id = current_setting('app.workspace_id')::uuid`. Set per request via `SET LOCAL` in a FastAPI middleware. MVP runs `workspace_id='default'` but the policies are real from day 1. | Per architecture §7. A dropped `WHERE workspace_id=...` is mathematically unable to leak across workspaces. Retrofitting RLS later is painful — every existing query needs auditing. Free now, expensive later. |
| 7 | Audit log table shape | **Ship the full partitioned shape at Phase 0**: range-partitioned by month on `created_at`, `workspace_id`+`query_id` indexes, `prev_hash`/`hash` columns. Defer the **hash-chain INSERT trigger + nightly integrity job** to Phase 9 (per architecture §12). | Partitioning is hard to add later without downtime; ship now. Hash trigger is a small additive at Phase 9 that doesn't change the table shape. |
| 8 | Phase 0 ↔ Phase 9 split | Phase 0 ships **stubs** of `audit_log` and `idempotency_keys` (full table shape, no enrichment). Phases 1–8 write to them. Phase 9 layers on: audit-log hash-chain trigger + integrity job + `GET /audit` read API + SSE lifecycle visibility endpoint. | Reconciles architecture §12 (Phase 9 owns "audit log + lifecycle + idempotency") with build_tracker §5 Phase 0 ("lifecycle DDL"). Lets phases 1–8 actually audit-log as they ship, without blocking on Phase 9. |

**Reversibility note:** if any module under `src/kb/` later needs its own package (e.g. shared lib, separate deploy target), that's a mechanical extract — cheaper than carrying multi-package scaffolding through 12 phases that may never need it.

#### docker-compose service plan

| Service | Image | Ports | Volumes | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `db` | `paradedb/paradedb:latest-pg17` | `5432:5432` | `pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` | — |
| `minio` | `minio/minio:latest` | `9000:9000` (S3), `9001:9001` (console) | `minio-data:/data` | — |
| `migrate` | built from `Dockerfile`; entrypoint `python -m migrations.runner` | — | — | `db` (healthy) |
| `api` | built from `Dockerfile`; entrypoint `uvicorn kb.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` | `8000:8000` | — | `migrate` (completed_successfully) |
| `worker` | built from `Dockerfile`; entrypoint `python -m kb.workers.run` | — | — | `migrate` (completed_successfully) |

**Notes:**
- Healthchecks: `db` → `pg_isready`; `minio` → HTTP `/minio/health/live`; `api` → `GET /health` once routes land at G2.
- Single `Dockerfile` for `api`, `worker`, `migrate` — different entrypoints over the same image. Keeps build cache tight.
- `migrate` runs as a short-lived one-shot init container (Compose `service_completed_successfully` condition gates `api` + `worker`).
- `.env.example` committed with placeholders. `pg-data/` and `minio-data/` gitignored.
- No separate broker — Procrastinate uses Postgres directly.

#### Lifecycle DDL — Phase 0 migrations (corrected scope, RLS day-1)

Phase 0 ships **four** migration files. Three carry `workspace_id` + an RLS policy from day 1 per architecture §7. The fourth (`schema_migrations`) is global infrastructure and has no workspace scope.

##### `0001_extensions.sql`

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;     -- pgvector ≥ 0.8 (HNSW + halfvec)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_search;  -- ParadeDB BM25
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;      -- hierarchical labels (Phase 3 doc-chains, Phase 7 lineage_path per architecture §7 / Design 7)

CREATE ROLE kb_app NOLOGIN;                -- application role; RLS applies. Login + password set by env at G4.
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE current_database() TO kb_app;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO kb_app;
```

No workspace scope. Runs first; everything else depends on these.

##### `0002_schema_migrations.sql` (no workspace_id — infrastructure)

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_migrations (
  id          text        PRIMARY KEY,           -- filename, e.g. '0003_audit_log.sql'
  applied_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Used by `migrations/runner.py` to track which files have been applied. No RLS — this is global infrastructure, not workspace data.

##### `0003_audit_log.sql` (full architecture shape, hash trigger deferred)

Architecture §6 lines 691–706 + §7 lines 850. Partitioned by month on `created_at` from day 1 (cannot retrofit cheaply). Hash chain columns present; the **INSERT trigger that fills them, plus the nightly integrity job**, lands at Phase 9.

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id            uuid         NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  workspace_id  uuid         NOT NULL,
  created_at    timestamptz  NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  actor         text         NOT NULL,           -- user_id or 'system:<service>'
  action        text         NOT NULL,           -- e.g. 'schema.create', 'query.run', 'extraction.update'
  entity_type   text,                            -- e.g. 'schema', 'doc', 'entity'
  entity_id     text,
  query_id      uuid,                            -- set on query-time audit rows (Phase 8+)
  payload       jsonb        NOT NULL,
  prev_hash     bytea,                           -- Phase 9 fills via INSERT trigger
  hash          bytea,                           -- Phase 9 fills via INSERT trigger
  PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)                   -- partition key must be in PK
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Initial partitions: current month + next month. A cron creates future months at Phase 9.
CREATE TABLE audit_log_2026_05 PARTITION OF audit_log
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2026-05-01') TO ('2026-06-01');
CREATE TABLE audit_log_2026_06 PARTITION OF audit_log
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2026-06-01') TO ('2026-07-01');

CREATE INDEX audit_log_ws_created_idx ON audit_log (workspace_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX audit_log_ws_query_idx   ON audit_log (workspace_id, query_id);

ALTER TABLE audit_log ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY audit_log_workspace_isolation ON audit_log
  USING (workspace_id = current_setting('app.workspace_id')::uuid);

-- Append-only at the DB-role level. Application role (kb_app) can INSERT/SELECT only.
-- Migration runs as superuser so this doesn't block DDL.
REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON audit_log FROM PUBLIC;
```

**Deferred to Phase 9** (do not ship in Phase 0):
- `INSERT` trigger that computes `prev_hash` and `hash`.
- Nightly integrity walker job.
- Partition-rotation cron (creates next month's partition).
- `GET /audit` API + SSE lifecycle endpoint.

##### `0004_idempotency_keys.sql` (workspace-scoped)

```sql
CREATE TABLE idempotency_keys (
  workspace_id  uuid         NOT NULL,
  key           text         NOT NULL,           -- value from Idempotency-Key header
  response      jsonb        NOT NULL,
  status_code   int          NOT NULL,
  created_at    timestamptz  NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (workspace_id, key)
);

CREATE INDEX idempotency_keys_created_idx ON idempotency_keys (created_at);

ALTER TABLE idempotency_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY idempotency_keys_workspace_isolation ON idempotency_keys
  USING (workspace_id = current_setting('app.workspace_id')::uuid);
```

Phase 1 (schema service) is the first phase to write here. Phase 9 may add a TTL cleanup job.

##### What is **not** shipped at Phase 0

- **`processing_status` / `file_lifecycle`** — removed from Phase 0. Architecture's canonical name is `file_lifecycle`. No `files` exist until Phase 2, so this table lands at Phase 2 (or Phase 9 per architecture §12's reading). Phase 2 G1 makes the call.
- **`corrections`, `entity_overrides`, `schema_field_overrides`, `regression_set`** — Phase 4 / Phase 9.
- **`config_overrides`** — Phase 5 when Hydra + OmegaConf land.
- **Procrastinate's `jobs` table** — Procrastinate's own migrations create this at first worker startup; we don't author its DDL.

Each later phase appends its own `NNNN_<purpose>.sql` files at its own G4. Numbering is global (linear apply order).

#### Migration runner behaviour

`python -m migrations.runner`:
1. Connect to the configured Postgres **as superuser** (DDL needs it; superuser also bypasses RLS so policies don't block table creation).
2. Bootstrap: if `schema_migrations` doesn't exist, apply `0002_schema_migrations.sql` and record it. Then proceed.
3. List `migrations/sql/*.sql` in lexical order.
4. For each file not yet recorded: run it inside a transaction; on success record `(id=filename, applied_at=now())`.
5. Idempotent: re-running with no new files does nothing.

**App vs migration role:** the application uses a non-superuser `kb_app` role created at first migration. RLS applies to `kb_app`; superuser (migrations + admin tasks) bypasses RLS. This split is created in `0001_extensions.sql`.

No rollback DSL — for DDL we write forward fixes. Standard in DDL-heavy systems.

#### Phase 0 G5 — what "green" means

`scripts/verify_phase_0.sh` lands at G5 and runs end-to-end:

1. `cp .env.example .env && docker compose up -d --build`
2. Wait for `db`, `minio`, `api`, `worker` healthy; `migrate` exited 0.
3. `psql` into `db` as superuser:
   - `\dx` includes `vector`, `pg_search`, and `ltree`.
   - `\dt` includes `schema_migrations`, `audit_log`, `idempotency_keys` (only these — no `file_lifecycle`, no `processing_status`).
   - `audit_log` is partitioned: `\d+ audit_log` shows partitioned table with `audit_log_2026_05` and `audit_log_2026_06` partitions.
   - RLS enabled on `audit_log` and `idempotency_keys`: `SELECT relname, relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN ('audit_log', 'idempotency_keys')` shows `relrowsecurity = t` for both.
   - `\du` includes the `kb_app` role.
4. As `kb_app` role with `SET app.workspace_id = '<some-uuid>'`: insert into `audit_log` succeeds; SELECT only returns rows matching the set workspace.
5. `curl http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` returns 200; `paths` contains `/health` and `/ready` (G2 contracts implemented by G4); no other paths.
6. `curl -i http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` response includes an `X-Request-Id` header (middleware proof).
7. `pytest tests/` is green (45 tests across health, ready, migrations, RLS, middleware).

## 9. Change log

> Append-only. Every gate transition, scope change, or plan revision lands here.

| Date | Change | By |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-22 | Build Tracker created. Pre-Phase-0 review opened. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Added G1.5 (Visual prototype) gate. Re-IA'd UI: chat-first home + Studio (Schema/Extraction/Playground) + Admin (Dashboard/Audit) sidebar. Studio vision per `archive/Problem_2.md` integrated. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Added G1.5b (Visual QA / Playwright) sub-gate + reusable `prototype/qa_checklist.md` template. Discipline: every prototype screen runs through Playwright screenshots + auto-checks at desktop/tablet/mobile + section-by-section manual review before sign-off. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Added §0.2 cross-cutting design rules (schema-everywhere, Doc Detail universal, ⌘K reachable, streaming over spinners, trust signals, sidebar/top-bar identical). | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Added §0.3 user-facing copy discipline. No Wave labels, phase numbers, internal design names (Design 1–9), library names (Hydra, OmegaConf, RAPTOR, HippoRAG, ColPali, Procrastinate), or `gaps_design.md §X` citations in production UI copy. QA gates this at G1.5b. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Added G1.6 (Wiring inventory) gate. Every interactive element on every screen → planned backend endpoint or marked client-only. `prototype/wiring_inventory.md` produced — ~210 elements audited, ~100 unique endpoints across 16 groups. Becomes the input set for G2. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | All 10 prototype screens built, QA-passed, signed off. Polish pass applied: doc names → Doc Detail · field pills → Schema Studio · doc-type badges → Schema Studio · query IDs → Audit · cited sources → Doc Detail. Cross-cutting §0.2 rules verified on every screen. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | Locked design back-ported into `docs/ui_design.md`. Prior version preserved at `docs/archive/ui_design_v1.md`. **Pre-Phase-0 review complete. Phase 0 G1 ready to open.** | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | **Phase 0 G1 OPEN.** Branched `phase-0/repo-skeleton`. Plan section §5.1 drafted: single-package `src/kb/` layout, ParadeDB image (bundles pgvector + pg_search), raw-SQL migration runner, narrow lifecycle DDL (extensions + `schema_migrations`, `audit_log`, `processing_status`, `idempotency_keys`), `uv`/`ruff`/`pyright`/`pytest` tooling, FastAPI skeleton (routes open at G2). Awaiting sign-off. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | **Phase 0 G1 ✅ SIGNED OFF.** Plan locked. Phase 0 G2 opens — API contracts for `/health` + `/ready` to land in `docs/api_contracts.md`. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-22 | **Phase 0 G2 drafted.** Created `docs/api_contracts.md` with §0 conventions (RFC 9457 errors, UUIDv7 IDs, ISO-8601 timestamps, idempotency headers, status code map) and §1 Phase 0 contracts: `GET /health` (liveness — process up, no dependency checks) and `GET /ready` (readiness — db + minio + migrations check, 503 with `application/problem+json` on fail, parallel checks with 5s budget). Awaiting sign-off. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-23 | **Gate-transition consistency review (G1+G2) ran before opening G3.** Six drifts surfaced against `docs/architecture.md`: (A) lifecycle tables had no `workspace_id` + RLS — architecture §7 mandates RLS day 1; (B) no FastAPI workspace middleware; (C) no X-Request-Id middleware (G2 §0.8 promised, G1 omitted); (D) `audit_log` shape under-specified vs architecture §6 (partitioning, hash columns, role grants); (E) `processing_status` was a fabrication — canonical name is `file_lifecycle`, belongs to Phase 2+; (F) Phase 0 ↔ Phase 9 split implicit — needed explicit reconciliation. Tech stack, gate discipline, branch+commit conventions all clean. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-23 | **Phase 0 G1 re-opened** to apply consistency fixes. §5.1 rewritten: lifecycle DDL shrinks to four files (`0001_extensions`, `0002_schema_migrations`, `0003_audit_log` full partitioned shape, `0004_idempotency_keys` workspace-scoped); RLS day-1 added as decision #6; audit-log shape as #7; Phase 0↔9 split as #8; `src/kb/api/middleware.py` added to layout (workspace context + X-Request-Id); G5 acceptance updated to verify partitions + RLS + request-id header. G2 contracts unchanged (re-validated against revised G1). Awaiting second sign-off. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-23 | **Phase 0 G1 ✅ and G2 ✅ both signed off.** Corrected §5.1 plan locked. G2 contracts in `docs/api_contracts.md` locked. G3 opens: test specs + red skeletons for `/health`, `/ready`, migration runner, RLS isolation, middleware. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-23 | **Phase 0 G3 drafted.** Created `tests/specs/phase_0.md` (test spec — 5 buckets, 41 test functions, testcontainers fixture strategy) + 6 skeleton files (`conftest.py`, `test_health.py`, `test_ready.py`, `test_migrations.py`, `test_rls.py`, `test_middleware.py`). Skeletons are RED — they import from `kb.*` modules that land at G4. Every G2 contract has a matching test; every G1 decision (RLS day-1, partitioning, middleware) has a matching test. Awaiting sign-off. | Aniket |
| 2026-05-23 | **Post-G3 cross-gate consistency sweep (G1↔G2↔G3↔architecture).** Five drifts fixed in one commit: (A) G1 plan §5.1 G5 acceptance #5 was stale post-G2 — said `/openapi.json` returns empty paths, but G4 will mount `/health` + `/ready`; corrected. (B) Spec test count was 41 (claimed) vs 45 (actual recount of first draft); corrected. (C) §3 missing `testcontainers-python` + `freezegun` (test fixtures); added as new row. (D) `ltree` extension missing from `0001_extensions.sql` per architecture §7 (required for Phase 3 doc-chains + Phase 7 lineage_path); added, also added `kb_app` role creation in 0001. §3 DB row updated to include ltree. (E) Unused fixtures (`set_workspace`, `frozen_time`) removed from `conftest.py`. Plus 4 new tests landed: `test_health_returns_json_content_type` (api_contracts §0.1) + 3 per-check timeout tests on `/ready` (api_contracts §1.2 check table). Final test count: 49 (was 45 at G3 first draft). | Aniket |
